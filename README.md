OP10 Multiple Media Picker is a great extension for the normal Media Picker

With this plugin you are allowed to change the media name within the content section.

For SEO ranking you can also select the "Physical Name" to change the media name on the server.

For those who like to do all steps with just a few clicks can also enable the quickview property which allows you to edit the data directly on the overview and not in the dialog.

The plugin supports also the Image Cropper!
